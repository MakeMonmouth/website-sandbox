## This Is Our Story.

We welcome makers of all ages, backgrounds, and skill levels, from craftspeople and DIY enthusiasts to tinkerers and tech-savvy hackers. 

Our mission is to provide a shared space where people can express their unique style and build amazing things using a wide range of tools and resources, from soldering irons and cutting mats to 3D printers and laser cutters. 

We also offer a variety of events and workshops, from open nights to specialized classes, to help our members develop new skills, connect with other makers, and pursue their passions.
