We are commited to providing a space that is open to all, and where discrimination of any kind is not left unchallenged.

Our [Code of Conduct](https://docs.makemonmouth.co.uk/en/latest/code-of-conduct/) applies to all and any events that we organise, including our Open Nights, Member Nights, and workshops.

It is our belief that by providing a space that is welcoming to all then the entire community, including those who are in minority groups, will be able to find a safe space to express themselves through art, craft, and making.
